# The CP table also shows us valueable information in terms of pruning the tree (which is explained later in the code)
# => The complexity parameter "CP" specifies how the cost of a tree C(T) is penalized by the number of terminal nodes |T|.
# Hence, Small "CP" results in larger trees and potential overfitting, large CP" in small trees and potential underfitting.
# => The "rel error" is 1- RSquare, similar to linear regression. This is the error on the observations used to estimate the model. The last node value of rel error suggests the R-Square of the model, if this happens to be the model
# => The "xerror" is is the error on the observations from cross validation data, which happens to be a 10-Fold Cross Validation. Particpants need to note that, in order to reproduce the "xerror" values, they must use the same set.seed() number each time
# => Root Node Error is given by sum((Dependent - Mean(Dependent))^2), i.e.
# sum((InsDataTrainUncapped$Losses-mean(InsDataTrainUncapped$Losses))^2

printcp(RDTree1)  # print CP values 
ptree = prune(RDTree1, cp=0.027) # select mid values and see the tree structure

# This produces a plot which may help to look for a model depending on R-Square values produced at various splits
